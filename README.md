# FIFA-21-Data-Cleaning
Data obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/data

Tried to re-do the data cleaning process from the problem set given in the link above. The creator provided the cleaned csv for me to replicate so I tried to follow along with my own codes from the get-go.
